Okay so what i want for my website is to ded have a naviagation bar at the top.
ir will most likely have to stay on the top nad i want it to have like dropdown links becuase those look nice
i want the background to be a neutral color. i dont want anything too colorful or too rowdy
I def want like white with a grey neutral background ish, ill figure out the exact color later on. It feels like im going to be
copying navid but im actually not. I also want a pic of me on the front cover
i want to be wearing this blue shit thi! like i want apic with def this shirt and 
i also want it paired with something greyish.
I want for my webstie to be able to feature my projects somehow.
you know what. i wan tht front page to be pretty blank with the "navigation bar" to be a guide on where to go.
there will be a section called projects. when you click on it, it will show a slow animation of everything from the website disappearing andthe other shit reappering.
this way you dont have to refresh the page or go to a diff one in order to see the diff websites. i also want to have 
a hover function that makes the recatngle pop out just a bit more than it already does! this way you cna see it clearly
which button you would want to click. 
in the projects tab tho, i want to be able to feature my ratatouille, i think im going to work on the pokemon battle too
and then put that on there too. if i ever do get ot finish playdead website, i will most def put it on there. it will be a pic of
website, with a description, and if you click on it, it will redirect you directly to the website.
I also want an about me section too. i want to be able to have a paragraph explaining how i am a rising web
developer that would like to be advancing his skills! it will also explain my education background and i most def got to flex
the bxsciiiiii gang! i want this page to have a pic of me too! i dont want it to be ugly and i want it side by side
with the description. i want the font to be like sorta tall but skinny, just like me! i also would like it if this didnt suck k thanks!
this website will also have more shit! i just have to think of more things!
next time you are off of it, you should just be doing these plan.js files for all your upcoming projects and see what ind of crazy mind you 
actually have nad how many more ideas you can produce.
